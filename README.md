## Conceptual Design

**Cookbook-Pro** is a primarily web-based application, developed with [React](https://react.dev/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). The backend of the web app consists of three different sections. The web portion of the application will use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), a cloud platform developed by Google. Firebase provides **Cookbook-Pro** with free hosting and user authentication, as well as a NoSQL database, and serverless-compute. The [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) is utilized for the recipes that appear in the search feature, as well as for ingredient and nutritional data. The recommendation system uses [OpenAI's GPT-4](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4) and [DALL-E3](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3) models to generate recipes and images. 

## Background

**Cookbook-Pro** is designed to simplify a user's cooking endeavors by offering a comprehensive platform for managing, organizing, and discovering recipes. The digitization of the concept of a "cookbook" allows users to effortlessly search for recipes and perform a range of actions based on them that are not possible within a traditional cookbook. Upon visiting the website, users are presented with a home screen offering options to log in or sign up using their Google account. Once authenticated, users gain access to the full functionality of the app, with various tabs for easy navigation.

Users can manage recipes by saving pre-existing ones, creating custom recipes, or saving recipes generated by ChatGPT. The application also allows users to create meal plans on the calendar, track them, order ingredient lists, and generate nutrition reports of their meals. The nutrition report section allows users to enter their daily macronutrient goals, creating a health baseline that can be later edited if needed. It also visualizes the nutritional data of their meals. **Cookbook-Pro** combines all these aspects to offer a modern take on the traditional cookbook, providing users with enhanced control and management over their recipes.


## Required Resources

To run this project, the user needs an active network connection, a device with an internet browser (preferably a desktop or laptop device), and a Google account. Then, the user simply needs to navigate to the site link and sign in.

## Building from Source

To build this project from source, one needs to either clone or zip/ownload the `main` branch from GitHub.

Ensure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is installed, then open the terminal and install all dependencies with `npm install`. 

Next, create a `.env` file. You will need to configure [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), acquire a [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) token, and an [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4) token. 

This is the layout of the `.env` file:

```
REACT_APP_COOKBOOK_PRO_EMAIL=
REACT_APP_SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

Simply enter your tokens and Firebase configurations after the = signs.

Now, run  `npm start` in order to launch the project.
